# Fake-News-Detection

## Overview
This project aims to detect fake news in Hindi using machine learning models. It processes datasets of real and fake news articles, trains classifiers, and evaluates performance based on accuracy and other metrics.

## Features
- Preprocesses Hindi text using custom cleaning functions.
- Implements models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN, and Random Forest.
- Provides metrics for performance evaluation.
- Visualizes data insights using word clouds and confusion matrices.

## Datasets
The dataset was collected and combined from two different sources:
1. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Siddhartha15/Hindi-Fake-News-Detection/main/Data/fake_news.csv
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Siddhartha15/Hindi-Fake-News-Detection/main/Data/true_news.csv
2. http://www.iitp.ac.in/~ai-nlp-ml/resources/data/TALLIP-FakeNews-Dataset.zip

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
